# Describe two specific goals you set for yourself and how successful you were in meeting them. What factors led to your success?

1. Learning Mongo Morphia driver - Which was the main task that I was assigned in the last quarter.
	1. My main objective was to upgrade 4 of the reviews application to the latest morphia version.
	2. Since I was assigned the task and I was so excited to learn mongoDb which is a nosql document db.
	3. As the application was a legacy I had some help from my seniors to grab an understanding of the exact flow and I 
	4. My measure for this task progress was all the apps getting upgraded to the latest morphia version and mongo gets upgraded to mongo 5 from mongo 3.4
	5. Obstacles which I faced was majorly due to lack of Documentation I had to go through the code of morphia and also through Mongo official documentation. But post that I thought of creating a ssmall project just to reproduce all the issues that I was facing and then solving them in the smaller project rather than the complete application which we have.

2. Enhancing Technical Skills - I learned about kafka through udemy course.
	1. Learning Plan: I developed a structured learning plan outlining the key concepts, 
		algorithms, and tools I wanted to master. This included online courses, office application, and practical coding exercises.
	2. Practice and Application: I dedicated time each day to practice coding and implement 
		machine learning algorithms in real-world projects. By applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems, I solidified my understanding and honed my skills.
	3. Collaboration and Feedback: I actively sought out opportunities to collaborate with 
		peers and mentors in the field. By participating in coding challenges, hackathons, and open-source projects, I received valuable feedback and learned from others' experiences.
	4. Continuous Learning: I adopted a growth mindset and committed to lifelong learning. 
		I stayed updated on the latest research papers, attended conferences, and participated in online forums and communities.
	5. In expedia we already had a bootstrap application to create a new kafka topic and register producer and consumer 
		applications to it.

# Tell me about a time when you failed to meet a deadline. What did you fail to do? What did you learn?

"I recall a project where I underestimated the complexity of a task, resulting in missing a deadline. I was tasked with developing a comprehensive marketing plan for a product launch. I failed to anticipate certain logistical challenges and didn't allocate enough time for unexpected hurdles. As a result, I couldn't deliver the finalized plan on time.

However, this experience taught me valuable lessons. Firstly, it underscored the importance of thorough planning and realistic time estimation. I learned to break down tasks into smaller, manageable components and allocate sufficient buffer time for unforeseen obstacles. Additionally, I realized the significance of proactive communication. By keeping stakeholders informed about potential delays early on, we can collectively strategize and mitigate any negative impacts.

Overall, this setback taught me resilience, improved my project management skills, and reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in a dynamic work environment."

"In one instance, I was leading a cross-functional team on a project aimed at streamlining our customer support process. Despite meticulous planning, we encountered unforeseen technical issues that significantly delayed our progress. As the deadline approached, it became evident that we wouldn't meet our original target.

While it was disappointing, this experience provided invaluable insights. Firstly, I learned the importance of fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration within the team. By openly discussing challenges as they arose, we were able to leverage the collective expertise to troubleshoot and find innovative solutions.

Secondly, I realized the necessity of building contingency plans into project timelines. Going forward, I implemented a more robust risk assessment process, identifying potential bottlenecks early and allocating resources accordingly.

Lastly, I took this setback as an opportunity for personal growth. I honed my communication skills, ensuring stakeholders were kept informed of our progress and any adjustments to the timeline. Moreover, I embraced a mindset of continuous improvement, seeking feedback and refining our processes for future projects.

Ultimately, while missing the deadline was a setback, it served as a catalyst for positive change. It reinforced the importance of resilience, adaptability, and proactive problem-solving in navigating complex projects."

# Handling a situation where overlapping work with another team is discovered late in the development process requires clear communication, collaboration, and a focus on the best outcome for the company. Here's how I would approach it:

Assessment and Analysis: Firstly, I would conduct a thorough analysis to understand the extent of the overlap and identify any differences or unique aspects between the two projects. This assessment would involve evaluating the goals, features, target audience, and potential impact of both projects.

Open Communication: Next, I would initiate open and transparent communication with the other team involved. It's essential to approach this conversation with a collaborative mindset rather than one of competition. By fostering a spirit of cooperation, we can work together to find the best path forward for both projects and the company as a whole.

Collaborative Solutions: During discussions with the other team, I would explore potential collaborative solutions. This could involve merging efforts where possible, sharing resources or technologies, or adjusting project scopes to minimize duplication of work. The goal is to leverage each team's strengths and expertise to create a more robust and comprehensive solution.

Alignment with Company Goals: Throughout the process, it's crucial to keep the company's overarching goals and priorities in mind. Any decisions made should align with these objectives and contribute to the overall success of the organization. If necessary, involving higher-level stakeholders or leadership to provide guidance and make strategic decisions can be beneficial.

Iterative Planning: Once a resolution is reached, I would work closely with both teams to revise project plans and timelines as needed. This may involve redefining project milestones, reallocating resources, or adjusting priorities to accommodate the changes. Clear communication with all stakeholders is key to ensuring everyone is aligned and informed throughout the process.

Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation: Even after reaching a resolution, it's important to continuously monitor progress and adapt as needed. Regular check-ins between teams can help identify any new challenges or opportunities for further collaboration, ensuring that both projects stay on track towards successful completion.

By approaching the situation with a focus on collaboration, communication, and alignment with company goals, we can navigate the challenges of overlapping work with another team effectively and ultimately deliver better outcomes for the organization.



# Certainly! Here's how I would handle the situation if there's significant pushback on coordination due to time constraints:

Assess Urgency: Evaluate the urgency of the situation and determine whether immediate action is required to address the overlap. If there's a critical deadline looming, it may be necessary to prioritize individual team efforts in the short term while still keeping long-term collaboration in mind.

Focus on Minimal Coordination: Recognizing the time constraints, prioritize minimal coordination efforts that can still mitigate duplication of work and ensure alignment where necessary. This could involve establishing basic communication channels, such as email updates or brief status meetings, to share high-level progress and identify potential conflicts.

Delegate Communication: Delegate communication responsibilities to designated team members who can serve as liaisons between the two teams. These individuals can help facilitate communication, address immediate concerns, and identify opportunities for collaboration without requiring extensive involvement from the broader teams.

Identify Critical Points of Intersection: Identify critical points of intersection where coordination is most crucial to avoid redundancy or conflicts. Focus efforts on these specific areas to maximize the impact of limited coordination resources while minimizing disruptions to individual team workflows.

Set Clear Boundaries: Establish clear boundaries and expectations for each team to ensure that essential tasks are completed without unnecessary overlap. Clarify ownership of specific components or features to minimize confusion and prevent duplication of effort.

Leverage Existing Resources: Utilize existing resources, such as project management tools or communication platforms, to streamline coordination efforts and minimize the time investment required from team members. Automation and centralized documentation can help facilitate information sharing and reduce the burden on individual contributors.

Iterative Improvement: Acknowledge that effective coordination may require iterative improvement over time. While immediate solutions may be limited by time constraints, commit to revisiting coordination efforts once immediate deadlines have passed to identify areas for improvement and strengthen collaboration moving forward.


# Certainly! Here's a response focusing on career growth:

"I decided to explore new opportunities primarily because I felt a strong desire for career growth and advancement. While I enjoyed my time at my previous company and learned a great deal, I reached a point where I felt that I had outgrown my role and was seeking new challenges and opportunities for development.

In reflecting on my career trajectory, I realized that I wanted to take on more responsibilities, tackle new projects, and expand my skill set in areas that aligned with my long-term goals. Despite expressing my aspirations and seeking opportunities for advancement within my previous team, I found limited avenues for growth that matched my ambitions.

Moving to a new team or company presented an opportunity for me to pursue roles with greater scope, responsibilities, and opportunities for advancement. I was drawn to organizations that offered clear paths for career progression, invested in employee development, and fostered a culture of continuous learning and growth.

While it was a difficult decision to leave behind the familiarity of my previous team, I knew that prioritizing my career growth was essential for long-term fulfillment and success. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my new role and am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to make meaningful contributions to the organization while continuing to grow and develop professionally."


# Tell Me About a Time You Disagreed With Your Boss? Question and Answer

I had the opportunity to share my perspective, In a previous role, my manager proposed a strategy for a project that I believed might not yield the optimal results. Rather than simply dismissing their idea, I respectfully presented an alternative approach, supported by data and examples. It sparked a constructive dialogue where we weighed the pros and cons of each option. Ultimately, we collaboratively decided to combine elements from both strategies, resulting in a more comprehensive and effective plan. 
* This experience reinforced the importance of open communication and constructive criticism in achieving our shared goals.
* AB testing that we were doing on the review forms there was skew in the data post runnning the AB testing and we were unable to certainly tell who was the winner. Issue with the new tables that were created for the Analytics purpose. I came up with a different approach to this and suggested him regarding directly querying our mongoDb and getting the proper amount of data. 
We would have brought down the mongo instance -> which would have created loss of revenue -> Not able to collect the reviews and hence might be some of the properties which would have got the new  review and hence more chances of getting a booking.


# Strength and Weekness

Strength: Adaptability
I possess a strong ability to adapt to changing circumstances and environments. Whether it's embracing new technologies, methodologies, or adjusting to shifts in project priorities, I thrive in dynamic situations. My adaptability allows me to stay agile and resourceful, ensuring that I can contribute effectively regardless of the challenges presented.

Strength: Team Player
Collaboration and teamwork are at the core of my professional approach. I actively foster a positive and inclusive team environment, valuing diverse perspectives and leveraging individual strengths. I'm adept at both contributing my own expertise and supporting others to achieve collective goals. My commitment to teamwork ensures that projects are completed efficiently and with high-quality results, while also fostering a supportive and cohesive work culture.

Weakness: Perfectionism
At times, my pursuit of perfection can lead to over-analysis and excessive attention to detail, which may delay decision-making or completion of tasks. While striving for excellence is important, I recognize the need to balance it with efficiency and pragmatism. I continually work on mitigating this tendency by setting realistic expectations and focusing on the broader goals of the project.
Even if there are solutions available I would want to apply the solution which will benefit us in longer run rather than a non-conventional method.
